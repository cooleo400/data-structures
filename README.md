# Data Structures
As I was going through an interview process I did some self implementations of different data structures and algorithms in Javascript. This is a repo for any (mostly myself) to keep track of these implementations and improve upon them in time.

### So far:
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Node (to be used with BST)
- Stack
- StackOfStacks (a structure that manages multiple Stack's)
